# React Component
The official react component library for our toggles built from the HTML package

## Usage
1. Install
```bash
yarn add @theme-toggles/react
# or
npm install @theme-toggles/react
```
2. Import css into app.js or equivalent
```js
// app.js or equivalent
import "@theme-toggles/react/dist/css/[toggle name].css"
```
> Note: You can import all css using bundle.css but this isn't recommended unless all toggles are being used, this will include unused css. 

3. Import and use the component, so the classic toggle would look like
```js
import { Classic } from "@theme-toggles/react"

<Classic />
```
### Reversed
All the toggles are reversible by using the Reversed component
```js
// app.js or equivalent
import "@theme-toggles/react/dist/css/ClassicReversed.css"
```
```js
import { ClassicReversed } from "@theme-toggles/react"

<ClassicReversed />
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout><SettingsLayout>{children}</SettingsLayout></Layout>
